The solution involves adjusting the `minSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` values in the `android/app/build.gradle` file to match the requirements of your project's dependencies.  You may need to increment the `minSdkVersion` value to a level supported by all your dependencies, and correspondingly set `targetSdkVersion`.  For example:
```gradle
android {
    compileSdkVersion 33
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "your.app.id"
        minSdkVersion 24 // Increased minSDK to resolve dependency conflicts
        targetSdkVersion 33
    }
}
```
It is critical to ensure that all libraries and dependencies used in your project are compatible with the chosen `minSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion`.  Refer to the documentation of your dependencies for supported API levels.
